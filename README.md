# Hello World!
I am a 31-year old enthusiastic gamer from Finland, currently studying programming and video game development.  
I am learning **C#, C++, UE5, Unity, Python, MySQL** for now.  
Experienced in graphical design, video editing and music composing. I also play piano & guitar.  
Started ICT studies and now I am practicing to use GitHub.
